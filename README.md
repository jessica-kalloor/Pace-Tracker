# Pace Monitoring Simulator
Using JSON data, I created a simulator to help people maintain pace.

This is useful for many of those who are affected by uneven walking gait and symmetry. 
For example, those who experience Parkinsons can use this tool to stay on pace, leading to better balance and less chance of falls.

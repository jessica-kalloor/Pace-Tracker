# AUDIO ASSISTED WALKING COMPANION 
## INTRO
This device can be beneficial to everyone, but I started this project based off those experiencing Parkinson’s. Sonifying walking routes for people with Parkinson's disease by creating auditory cues helps them navigate and maintain their mobility more effectively. The need for sonifying walking routes for individuals with Parkinson's disease stems from the specific challenges they face related to mobility and spatial awareness. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that can cause various motor symptoms, including gait disturbances, freezing of gait, and difficulty with turns and obstacles. These symptoms can significantly impact a person's ability to walk safely and independently.

## System Components
### Hardware
A smartphone or wearable device equipped with motion sensors to capture the user’s movement data 

### Software
The sonification app, which processes the sensor data and generates auditory cues based on desired goals. 

## Getting Started 
1. Select a Walking Route: Choose a walking route or path that you would like to navigate using the Sonification System. I was only able to calibrate the Pi Mile for now, but there is an opportunity to expand! 

2. Calibrate Settings: Before starting your walk, adjust the sonification parameters (e.g., pace, gait pattern intensity, music volume) according to your preferences and needs. These settings can be customized within the app's settings menu. 

3. Start Walking: Begin walking along the selected route while keeping your device with you. The Sonification System will capture your movement data in real-time. 

4. Listen to Auditory Cues: As you walk, you can choose if you want the app to generate auditory cues based on your movement data. These cues may include rhythmic beats, tones, or other sound patterns that correspond to various aspects of your walking behavior. 

5. Monitor Feedback: Continuously monitor the feedback provided by the Sonification System to assess your walking performance and make any necessary adjustments to your technique or behavior.

## Sonification Scheme
Adjust the following parameters to understand how the data modifies the sounds: 

1. The user's walking pace is represented by the tempo of rhythmic beats or pulses. Faster tempos indicate faster walking speeds, while slower tempos correspond to slower speeds. 

2. Gait Pattern Intensity: Changes in gait pattern intensity are mapped to variations in pitch, volume, or timbre of the auditory cues. Higher intensity levels may result in louder or more complex sounds, indicating a more forceful gait pattern. 

3. Heart Rate: When the heart rate gets high, a computer voice notifies the user.

## Scenarios:
You can try out doing different walking speeds, or different gait pattern intensities. You can also try different music volumes. 

## Conclusion
This system offers a way for enhancing mobility and navigation for individuals with Parkinson's disease. By converting movement data into auditory cues, the system provides real-time feedback and assistance during walking routes, promoting independence, safety, and confidence. Explore different scenarios and settings to optimize your walking experience with the Sonification System.
